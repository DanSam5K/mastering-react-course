# How React Works
- React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- React is declarative, which means you describe what you want to happen, and React takes care of the rest.
- React uses a virtual DOM to update the actual DOM efficiently.
- React uses components to build user interfaces.
- React components are reusable and composable.
- React components can be stateful or stateless.
- React components can be functional or class components.
- React components can be tested using Jest and React Testing Library.
