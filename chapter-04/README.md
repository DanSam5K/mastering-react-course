# How React Works
- React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- React is declarative, which means you describe what you want to happen, and React takes care of the rest.
- React uses a virtual DOM to update the actual DOM efficiently.
- React uses components to build user interfaces.
- React components are reusable and composable.
- React components can be stateful or stateless.
- React components can be functional or class components.
- React components can be tested using Jest and React Testing Library.
- React components can be styled using CSS, CSS Modules, or styled-components.
- React components can be used in a single-page application or a multi-page application.
- React components can be server-side rendered.
- React components can be used with other libraries and frameworks.
- React components can be used with TypeScript.
- React components can be used with Redux, MobX, or other state management libraries.
- React components can be used with React Router, Reach Router, or other routing libraries.
- React components can be used with React Query, SWR, or other data fetching libraries.
- React components can be used with React Helmet, React Icons, or other utility libraries.
- React components can be used with React Testing Library, Jest, or other testing libraries.
- React components can be used with Storybook, Chromatic, or other design systems.
- React components can be used with Next.js, Gatsby, or other static site generators.
- React components can be used with Create React App, Vite, or other build tools.
- React components can be used with ESLint, Prettier, or other linting tools.
- React components can be used with Husky, lint-staged, or other pre-commit hooks.
- React components can be used with GitHub Actions, Travis CI, or other continuous integration tools.
- React components can be used with Netlify, Vercel, or other deployment platforms.
- React components can be used with Firebase, AWS, or other cloud services.
- React components can be used with Stripe, PayPal, or other payment gateways.
- React components can be used with Auth0, Firebase Auth, or other authentication providers.
- React components can be used with Apollo Client, SWR, or other GraphQL clients.
- React components can be used with React Query, SWR, or other data fetching libraries.
- React components can be used with React Testing Library, Jest, or other testing libraries.

# React Elements
- React elements are the building blocks of React applications.
- React elements are lightweight descriptions of what to render.
- React elements are immutable and are cheap to create.
- React elements are plain JavaScript objects.
- React elements are created using JSX.
- React elements are rendered using `ReactDOM.render`.
- React elements are updated using `ReactDOM.render`.
- React elements are created using `React.createElement`.
- React elements are updated using `React.createElement`.
- React elements are destroyed using `React.createElement`.

# Summary
- In chapter 4 we look at how we use react create elements and how react elements are the building blocks of react applications.
